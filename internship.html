                3 Idiots (2009) is a Bollywood comedy-drama film directed by Rajkumar Hirani and based on the novel
                "Five Point Someone" by Chetan Bhagat.
                The movie revolves around the lives of three engineering students, Farhan (R. Madhavan), Raju (Sharman
                Joshi), and Rancho (Aamir Khan), who form an inseparable bond during their time at an elite engineering
                college in India.
                The story unfolds through a series of flashbacks, with Farhan and Raju embarking on a journey to find
                their long-lost friend, Rancho. Along the way, they recall how Rancho's unorthodox approach to education
                and life had a profound impact on them.
                Rancho constantly challenged the traditional education system, promoting creativity, passion, and the
                idea of pursuing excellence over success.
